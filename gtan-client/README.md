# What are these?

These files are of the in-development GTA Network client. If you see bugs, please report them ASAP.

Place these files in `bin/scripts` in your GTAN install.

**Do not distribute these files without explicit consent from stardust.**

## When should I do this?

As often as you notice it changing. The GTAN server in `server/GTANetwork/~refs` in this repo matches with this client.
